    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <uo>
        4 ripe bananas, cut into chunks

        1 ¼ cups light brown sugar
        
        ½ cup butter, softened
        
        1 jumbo egg
        
        ¼ cup whole milk
        
        1 teaspoon cinnamon
        
        1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        
        2 cups all-purpose flour
        
        1 teaspoon baking powder
        
        ½ teaspoon baking soda
        
        ½ teaspoon kosher salt
    </uo>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.

        Place bananas into a large resealable plastic bag; seal the bag and smoosh bananas with your fingers until well mashed. Set aside.
        
        Mix together brown sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. Cut a corner from the plastic bag; squeeze mashed bananas into brown sugar mixture in the bowl. Add egg, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla; beat on medium speed until well combined. Mix in flour, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt on low speed just until smooth, about 1 minute. Spread into the prepared loaf pan.
        
        Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned on top and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
